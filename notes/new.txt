hardware
- main storage
- secondary storage
- input output

software
- os apps
- applications

cpu
- reads
- doing math
- macine language(binary)
- fetchs code from ram
- assembly

code
- low level
- high level
- syntax - structure we have to follow
- compiled languages and interpretted

errors
- sytnax
- semantic
- runtime

binary
- 8 1s and 0s is a byte
- 1 is a bit
- 1000 is a kilobit
- bits act as switches(true false)
- negative numbers use the 2s compliment

Designing a Program
- Program development cycle
        Design prog
        write the code
        correct syntax

- Understand the task that the program is to perform
        work with customer to get a sense what the program is supposed to do
        ask questions about program detais
        create one or more software requirements

- Determin the steps that must be taken to prerform the task
        break down required task into a series of steps
        creat an algorithm listing logical steps that must be taken

- Algorithm (set of well-defined logical steps that must be taken to perform a
  task)

Pseudocode
- informal language that has no syntax rule
- not meant to be compiled or executed
- used to create model program

Flowcharts
- ovals are terminal symbols
- prallelograms are input and ouput symbold
- rectangles are processing symbols
- symbols are connected by arrows that represent the flow of the program

Input, Processing and Output
- Receie input
- Preform some process on the input
- produce output

Displaying output
- Funciton
- Argument
- Statements in a program execut in the order that they appear
        from top to bottom

Strings and string literals
- string (sequence of characters that is used as data)
- string literal(string that appears in actual code of a program
        must be enclosed in single ' or double " quote marks
        string literal can be enclosed in triple qoutes (''' or """)

Comments
- ignored by python
- end-line comment appears at the end of a line of code

Variables
- used to access and manipulate data stored in memory
- a variable references the value it represents
- General format is variable = expression
- In assignment statement variable receiving value must be on left side
- a variable can be passed a an argument to a function
- you can only use a variable if a value is assigned to it
- Naming Rules
        - variable name cannot be a python key word
        - variable name cannot contain spaces
        - first character must be a letter or an underscore
        - after first character may use letters digits or underscores
        - variable names are case sensitive

PascalCase
camelCase
snake_case

Variable reassignment
- Garbage collection (removal of values that are no longer referenced by
  variables
- A variable can refer to item of any type
        - variable that has been assigned to one type can be reassigned to
          another type

data types
- int for integer float for real number str used for storing strings in memory
- no decimal point considered int otherwise considered float

Reading input from the keyboard
- most programs need to read input from the user
- built-in input function reads input from keyboard
        returns the data as a string 
        format: variable = input(prompt)
        Does not automatically display a space after the prompt

Reading nums with the input func
- input function always returns a string
- built-in functions convert between satatypes
        int converts item to an int
        float converts item to a float
        nested function call: general format
        type conversion only works if item is valid numeric value, ohterwise,
        throws exception
        nested function call: general format
        function1(function2(argument))

        Casting turns str to ints

performing calculations
- math expression: perfomrs calculation and gives a value
        math operator
        operands
- two types of division
        / operator performs floating point division
        // operator performs integer division

operator precedence and grouping with parantheses
- python does pemdas
- Higher precedence performed first
        same precedence operators execute from left to right

Breaking long statements
- Multiline continuation character \

String concatenation
- To append one string to the end of another string 
- Use the + operator to concatenate strings
- Two or more string literals written adjacent to each other are inplicitly
  concatenated

Print Func
- has the end='delimiter' and the sep='delimiter' arguments

Displaying formatted output with f-strings
- an f-string is a special type of string literal that is prefixed twith the
  letter f
- f-strings support placeholders for variables
-placeholders can also be expressions that are evaluated
- format specifiers can be used with placeholders
- .2f means:
        round the value to 2 decimal places
        display the value as a floating-point number
- The order [alignment][width][,][.precision][type]

The problem with magic numbers

named Constants
- You should use named constants instead of magic numbers
- a named constant is a name that represents a value that does not change during the programs execution
- EX
        INTEREST_RATE = 0.069
- This creates a named constatn named INTEREST_RATE assigned the value 0.069. It can be used instead of the magic number:
        amout = balance * INTEREST_RATE

Advantages of using named constants
- maked code self-explanatory

sep 17

The if statement
- control structure
        logical design that controls order in which set of statement
- sequence structure
        set of statements that execute in the order they appear
- decision structure
        specific actions performed only if a condition exists

Boolean Expressions and relational operators
- Either True or False
        Example: a > b
        true if a is greater than b otherwise false

Repetition Structures
- often have to write code that performs the same task multiple times
		makes program large

while loops
